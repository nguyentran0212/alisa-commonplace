title: Undue attention
---
## How to identify: 

1. The adult feels/thinks: annoyed; worried

2. The adult tends to: reminding; coaxing; doing things that the child could do for himself

3. The child’s response is:

\-Stop temporarily but resume the same (or another challenging behaviour)

\-Stop when given one-to-one attention or something special



## Belief Behind children:

* I belong only when I’m getting noticed or getting special service
* I‘m important only when I’m keeping you busy with me



## Encouragement to undue attention:

1. Meaningful involvement - get attention in useful ways

   \-Ignore misbehaviour while redirecting a child to get attention in useful way
2. Teach non-verbal signals

   \-gently place a hand on your arm to let you know she is needed

   \-make eye contact with the child, hold up an index finger, then resume what you are doing
3. Special attention before the child seeks undue attention

   \-commnet on something that makes each child feels special

   \-greet children individually
