> Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. 
>
> Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. 
> 
> Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's responses.

This website is the commonplace notebook of Alisa for storing nuggets of insights and experiences about early childhood education, as well as other endeavours.
