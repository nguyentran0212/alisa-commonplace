title: Communication with Parents

1. Comfort parents. When parents seem to be concerned about whether their child would get bullied in school, reassure them first. Instead of finding any excuse for the ‘bully’

   We know that the child would be safe and there is no bully in school, but parents seem to doubt about it. Especially when they hear their kid talk about the bully.

   Understand parents’ point of view, acknowledge their concern, and then reassure them that we will keep an eye on it. 

   When it comes to being pushed or hit, we have to be serious about it. At least letting parents know that we will take care of it and look after their child well.
