title: Teaching Pitch
---
What worked well:

1. Climbing up the stairs (major c scale) (Can start from the beginning of the term)
2. Use imagination to do the scale (going up and going down) + Keyboard

   * Going up/down the stairs steady
   * Going on an adventure: go up the hill - stop half way - keep going to the top - run down the hill (Pitch: high - higher; high low)
   * Bear hunt: go down slowly and carefully (Low - lower); run out of the cave; come bact to the house.
