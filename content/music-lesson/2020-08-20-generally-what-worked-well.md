title: Generally what worked well
---
1. Children love to have their names being sung in the Good morning song (This is also a great way to refill the emotional bank tank for children who might seek undue attention!!!)
2. They love me playing ukulele
3. Song cubes worked well. High/low, slow/fast, soft/loud; 6 songs
4. Children love to explore concepts by acting it out and through their imagination
5. Music teacher should always be dramatic when talking to the group. This would literally catch children’s attention and improve the engagement
