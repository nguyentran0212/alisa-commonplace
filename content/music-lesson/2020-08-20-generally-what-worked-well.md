title: Generally what worked well
---
1. Children love to have their names being sung in the Good morning song (This is also a great way to refill the emotional bank tank for children who might seek undue attention!!!)
2. They love me playing ukulele
3. Song cubes worked well. High/low, slow/fast, soft/loud; 6 songs
4. Children love to explore concepts by acting it out and through their imagination
