What worthwhile trying:

1. Play heartbeat, clock ticking sound etc for children to feel what beat is. Itâ€™s steady. It can be slow, it can be fast.
2. Rhythm: 4/4 beat. 

   * Four cupcake holders with four stones inside. 
   * Four cupcake holders with 3 stones, one empty
   * Four cupcake holders with 2 stones, 2 empty 
   * Encourage the children to change the homes for the stones, the number of stones, etc
